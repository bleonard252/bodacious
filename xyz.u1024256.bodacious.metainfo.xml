    <p>
      Bodacious is a multi-platform music player for playing your local files first and foremost. Its design is inspired by Spotify, it&apos;s built with Flutter, and it&apos;s open source, which means if you think Bodacious is missing a feature, you can add it yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Features include:
      <ul>
        <li>Custom libraries: choose where you want your music to come from</li>
        <li>Familiar UI</li>
        <li>Last.fm scrobbling (enable in Settings)</li>
        <li>Last.fm, MusicBrainz, and Spotify metadata at your fingertips (enable in Settings)</li>
        <li>(Desktop only) Discord Rich Presence</li>
        <li>Queue control (mostly)</li>
        <li>Most* of your basic features (apparently equalizers are essential now?)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming soon:
      <ul>
        <li>Reorder items in the queue</li>
        <li>Custom metadata: set custom covers, names, and descriptions for music, which (if you want) can only display in Bodacious</li>
        <li>MSE support: Music Synchronized Effects are a new way to use your existing app as a visualizer. MSE files can instruct Bodacious to change the background, cover, or lyrics on the fly to add a little more visual pizzazz to your music.</li>
        <li>Equalizer. I personally never use this but whatever</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
