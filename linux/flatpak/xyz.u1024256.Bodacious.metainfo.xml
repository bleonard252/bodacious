    <p>
      Bodacious is a multi-platform music player for playing your local files first and foremost. Its design is inspired by Spotify, it&apos;s built with Flutter, and it&apos;s open source, which means if you think Bodacious is missing a feature, you can add it yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom libraries: choose where you want your music to come from</li>
      <li>Familiar UI</li>
      <li>Last.fm scrobbling (enable in Settings)</li>
      <li>Last.fm, MusicBrainz, and Spotify metadata at your fingertips (enable in Settings)</li>
      <li>(Desktop only) Discord Rich Presence</li>
      <li>Queue control (mostly)</li>
      <li>Most* of your basic features (apparently equalizers are essential now?)</li>
    </ul>
