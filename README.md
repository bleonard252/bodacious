# Bodacious
Bodacious is a multi-platform music player for playing your local files first and foremost. Its design is inspired by Spotify, it's built with Flutter, and it's open source, which means if you think Bodacious is missing a feature, you can add it yourself! Bodacious is also available as an AppImage for Linux: https://github.com/bleonard252/bodacious/releases

Features include:
* Custom libraries: choose where you want your music to come from
* Familiar UI
* Last.fm scrobbling (enable in Settings)
* Last.fm, MusicBrainz, and Spotify metadata at your fingertips
* Queue control (mostly)
* Most* of your basic features (apparently equalizers are essential now?)

Coming soon:
* Reorder items in the queue
* Custom metadata: set custom covers, names, and descriptions for music, which (if you want) can only display in Bodacious
* MSE support: Music Synchronized Effects are a new way to use your existing app as a visualizer. MSE files can instruct Bodacious to change the background, cover, or lyrics on the fly to add a little more visual pizzazz to your music.
* Equalizer. I personally never use this but whatever
